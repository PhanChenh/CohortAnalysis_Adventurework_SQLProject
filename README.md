# Project Title: Customer Retention and Lifetime Value Analysis Using Cohort Analysis on AdventureWorks Dataset

## Project Overview:

Dataset: AdventureWorks2022.bak (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms)

Cohort analysis is a technique used to track and analyze the behavior of groups of users (cohorts) over time. A cohort is a group of people who share a common characteristic within a specific time frame, such as their first purchase date, sign-up date, or first interaction with a company.

In business intelligence, cohort analysis helps understand customer retention, lifetime value, and purchase behavior trends by examining how different cohorts behave over time.

- Retention rate measures the percentage of customers who continue to do business with a company over a specified period, indicating how well a company is keeping its customers. Itâ€™s an important metric for understanding customer loyalty and the effectiveness of retention strategies.

- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a predictive metric that estimates the total revenue or profit a business can expect from a customer during their entire relationship with the company. CLV helps businesses determine how much they should invest in acquiring and retaining customers.
