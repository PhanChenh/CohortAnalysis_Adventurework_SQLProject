This dataset contains transactional data from AdventureWorks, a fictional retail company, including sales, products, and customer orders.

## Objective

This project aims to analyze customer retention trends and identify churn patterns to better understand customer behavior over time. Additionally, it will measure and predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to assess the long-term revenue potential of different customer segments. The project will also segment customer cohorts based on their purchasing behavior to uncover meaningful trends and patterns. It will evaluate the impact of promotions and seasonal trends on retention rates and, ultimately, provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve customer loyalty, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance overall business performance.

## Analysis Approach
1. Data Preparation:
- Extract fields such as CustomerID, OrderDate, and TotalDue.
- Convert OrderDate into cohort-based timeframes (Year/Month).
2. Cohort Identification:
- Assign each customer to a cohort based on their first purchase date.
- Track cohort behavior over time.
3. Customer Retention Analysis:
- Measure how many customers return in each subsequent month.
- Calculate retention rates per cohort and visualize trends.
4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis:
- Analyze revenue per cohort and calculate cumulative revenue over time.
- Identify high-value cohorts that contribute the most revenue.
5. Churn & Loyalty Analysis:
- Segment customers into one-time buyers, occasional buyers, and loyal customers.
- Compare the revenue contributions of loyal vs. churned customers.
6. Cohort Behavior Segmentation:
- Examine purchase frequency, seasonal trends, and the effect of promotions.
7. Interpret Results:
- Analyze trends, retention, and CLV to understand customer behavior and identify key factors.
8. Recommendations:
- Improve retention with loyalty programs.
- Focus marketing on new cohorts and seasonal trends.
- Re-engage at-risk customers to reduce churn.

## Key Findings
- Repeat Purchases: Strong correlation between repeat customers and retention rates.
- Retention Decline: Retention tends to decline over time, suggesting the need for proactive retention strategies.
- Seasonal Trends: Higher retention observed in certain months (May to August), indicating the importance of seasonality in engagement.
- Cohort Performance: Larger cohorts generally show lower retention rates, suggesting that segmenting cohorts could improve engagement.

## Project Overview:

Dataset: AdventureWorks2022.bak (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms)

Cohort analysis is a technique used to track and analyze the behavior of groups of users (cohorts) over time. A cohort is a group of people who share a common characteristic within a specific time frame, such as their first purchase date, sign-up date, or first interaction with a company.

In business intelligence, cohort analysis helps understand customer retention, lifetime value, and purchase behavior trends by examining how different cohorts behave over time.

- Retention rate measures the percentage of customers who continue to do business with a company over a specified period, indicating how well a company is keeping its customers. Itâ€™s an important metric for understanding customer loyalty and the effectiveness of retention strategies.

- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a predictive metric that estimates the total revenue or profit a business can expect from a customer during their entire relationship with the company. CLV helps businesses determine how much they should invest in acquiring and retaining customers.

## Objectives:

This project aims to analyze customer retention trends and identify churn patterns to understand customer behavior over time. Addition to that, measure and predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to assess the long-term revenue potential of different customer segments. Additionally, the project will segment customer cohorts based on their purchasing behavior to uncover trends and patterns. It will also evaluate the impact of promotions and seasonal trends on retention rates. Finally, the project will provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve customer loyalty, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance overall business performance.

Figure 4: Cohort Analysis - Retention Rates

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RETENTION:

1. Leverage Repeat Purchases to Improve Retention
- Recommendation: Since repeat purchases significantly contribute to retention (as shown by the positive correlation between return customers and retention rate), focus on improving loyalty programs or introducing personalized offers to encourage customers to return. 

For example:
- Implement a rewards program where customers earn points for each purchase, which can be redeemed for discounts or exclusive offers.
- Target frequent buyers with exclusive deals or early access to new products to maintain their engagement.
2. Optimize Marketing Campaigns for Newer Cohorts
- Observation: Newer cohorts tend to be larger, but they also have lower retention rates. This suggests that while your business is successfully acquiring new customers, you may struggle with retaining them over time.
- Recommendation: Focus marketing efforts on new customer onboarding to improve retention for these larger cohorts. 

Consider:
- Sending personalized welcome emails with special first-time buyer offers.
- Offering post-purchase follow-ups to enhance the initial experience and remind customers of additional products that may interest them.
- Utilizing email automation to nurture these customers into loyal, repeat buyers.
3. Address Declining Retention with Proactive Strategies
- Observation: There's a slight decline in retention over the years, possibly due to changing customer behavior or increased competition.

To combat this decline, you should consider:
- Predictive churn models: Use past customer behavior (e.g., purchase frequency, basket size) to identify customers who are at risk of churn. Send targeted retention offers to re-engage these customers before they fully disengage.
- Enhancing the customer experience through personalized recommendations, superior customer service, and more tailored communications.
- Post-purchase engagement: Use automated email sequences to re-engage customers who havenâ€™t made a purchase in a while. Offer discounts, ask for feedback, or highlight new product arrivals to bring them back.
4. Improve Retention for Customers Acquired in Late Months
- Observation: Cohort months later in the year show slightly lower retention, possibly due to seasonal effects.
- Recommendation: For customers acquired in later months, create seasonal retention strategies that align with their purchasing habits. 

This could include:
- Targeted ads or offers that are relevant to their interests during the off-season.
- Offering seasonal promotions or exclusive end-of-year sales to incentivize purchases after their initial engagement.
- Encourage engagement with reminder emails for products they might need to restock, like seasonal items or accessories.
5. Maximize Cohort Engagement in Months 5-7
- Observation: Higher retention rates are seen in cohorts from months 5 to 7.
- Recommendation: Since retention is higher in these months, identify and replicate the drivers that contribute to stronger engagement. 

Consider:
- Timing your promotions: Ensure that promotions or new product releases are aligned with these peak engagement months to maximize their impact.
- Upselling or cross-selling: In these high-engagement months, upsell customers with complementary products or offer package deals that encourage larger orders.
6. Investigate and Enhance Engagement with Customers from Cohorts After 2013-06
- Observation: After June 2013, return customers seem to make purchases more regularly across cohorts.
- Recommendation: Investigate what changed in your customer experience or marketing strategy post-2013 to better understand why this pattern emerged.

Consider:
- Analyze changes in product offerings, pricing, or marketing approaches that could have contributed to the increased regularity of returns.
- Use these insights to enhance personalization across customer segments, making the buying experience more tailored and rewarding for customers.
7. Monitor and Manage Cohorts with Low Engagement
- Observation: Cohorts from 2011-05 to 2013-05 stopped purchasing by 2014-06, possibly due to market saturation or competitive pressures.
- Recommendation: For these groups, take proactive steps to either re-engage or gracefully disengage. 

Consider:
- Conducting win-back campaigns that offer customers incentives to return, such as discounts or bundled deals.
- Exit surveys for customers who stop purchasing to understand the root causes (pricing, competition, product dissatisfaction) and adapt your offerings.
- If market saturation is the issue, consider diversifying your product range or offering exclusive, limited-time products to reignite interest in these cohorts.
8. Utilize Seasonality to Drive Engagement
- Observation: Cohorts from May to August show higher return rates, likely due to seasonal effects or marketing efforts.

Maximize seasonal trends by:
- Running seasonal promotions targeting these months and using time-sensitive discounts to create urgency.
- Offering products that are seasonally relevant to these cohorts, such as summer or holiday-related items, to drive purchases.
- Consider launching seasonal campaigns or events in these months to build excitement and reinforce customer loyalty.
9. Improve Retention for Larger Cohorts
- Observation: Larger cohorts tend to show lower retention rates.

To address this, you might need to:
- Segment larger cohorts into smaller groups based on behavior, demographics, or product preferences and then tailor retention efforts to each group.
- Implement targeted retention strategies for high-value customers within large cohorts, such as VIP programs, early access to products, or personalized offers.

Figure 6: Cumulative Lifetime Value by cohort

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE 

1. Analyze Spending Spikes: 
- Identify the drivers behind spending spikes in specific months (e.g., 2011-07, 2012-04, 2013-12) to replicate successful promotions or seasonal strategies during those periods.

2. Focus on Retention: 
- Address the drop in spending over time by enhancing retention strategies, especially for cohorts showing signs of churn after the first year. This could include personalized outreach or loyalty programs.

3. Investigate Data Gaps: 
- Investigate the missing values to determine whether they indicate actual customer inactivity or data reporting issues. This will improve accuracy in CLV predictions and retention analysis.

4. Tailor Acquisition Strategies: 
- Recognize that different cohorts (e.g., 2011-06 vs. 2012-06) have different behaviors. Adapt customer acquisition strategies to meet the expectations and preferences of each cohort.

5. Nurture Early-Stage Customers: 
- Target early-stage customers with engaging strategies to turn them into repeat buyers, reducing churn and maximizing CLV.

6. Leverage Promotions and External Events: 
- Use knowledge of seasonal trends and promotions (e.g., May-Aug) to plan campaigns that align with high-revenue periods and customer purchasing behavior.

7. Enhance Post-2013 Cohorts: 
- Since post-2013 cohorts show more sustained revenue, focus on expanding this trend with strategies that maintain engagement and repeat purchases.

8. Address Churn in Older Cohorts: 
- For older cohorts (e.g., 2011-2013), analyze why customers stop purchasing (e.g., shift in strategy, product issues, competition) and adjust business practices to prevent churn.
