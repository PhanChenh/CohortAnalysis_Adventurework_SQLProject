# Project Title: Customer Retention and Lifetime Value Analysis Using Cohort Analysis on AdventureWorks Dataset

## Project Overview:

Dataset: AdventureWorks2022.bak (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms)

Cohort analysis is a technique used to track and analyze the behavior of groups of users (cohorts) over time. A cohort is a group of people who share a common characteristic within a specific time frame, such as their first purchase date, sign-up date, or first interaction with a company.

In business intelligence, cohort analysis helps understand customer retention, lifetime value, and purchase behavior trends by examining how different cohorts behave over time.

- Retention rate measures the percentage of customers who continue to do business with a company over a specified period, indicating how well a company is keeping its customers. Itâ€™s an important metric for understanding customer loyalty and the effectiveness of retention strategies.

- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a predictive metric that estimates the total revenue or profit a business can expect from a customer during their entire relationship with the company. CLV helps businesses determine how much they should invest in acquiring and retaining customers.

## Objectives:

Analyze customer retention, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), churn patterns, and cohort behavior

## Project Structure:
1. Data Preparation
- Extract necessary fields (CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalDue).
- Convert OrderDate to cohort-based timeframes (Year/Month).
2. Cohort Identification
- Identify the first purchase date (cohort) for each customer.
- Assign customers to their respective cohorts (Year/Month).
3. Customer Retention Analysis
- Track how many customers return in each subsequent month.
- Calculate retention rates for each cohort.
- Visualize retention trends in a matrix.
4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis
- Calculate revenue per cohort over time.
- Compute cumulative revenue per cohort.
- Identify high-value cohorts contributing the most revenue.
5. Churn & Loyalty Analysis
- Determine when customers stop purchasing (churn point).
- Segment customers into one-time buyers, occasional, and loyal customers.
- Compare revenue contribution of loyal vs. churned customers.
6. Cohort Behavior Segmentation
- Analyze purchase frequency per cohort.
- Identify seasonal trends in purchasing behavior.
- Assess the impact of promotions on retention.
7. Insights & Recommendations
- Suggest strategies to improve retention (e.g., loyalty programs).
- Identify the best-performing customer segments for targeted marketing.
- Optimize product offerings based on cohort preferences.

## Analyze customer retention Rate

1. Identify the Cohort for Each Customer
```sql
-- This query finds the first purchase date (month) for each customer:
WITH FirstPurchaseCohort AS (
    SELECT
        CustomerID,
        DATEPART(YEAR, MIN(OrderDate)) AS CohortYear, -- Get the Year of the first purchase
        DATEPART(MONTH, MIN(OrderDate)) AS CohortMonth -- Get the Month of the first purchase
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
    GROUP BY CustomerID
)
SELECT * FROM FirstPurchaseCohort
ORDER BY CohortYear ASC, CohortMonth ASC;
```

2. Combine Cohort Data with Orders
```sql
--Join the cohort data with order data to track customer purchases over time:
WITH FirstPurchaseCohort AS (
    SELECT
        CustomerID,
        DATEPART(YEAR, MIN(OrderDate)) AS CohortYear, -- Get the Year of the first purchase
        DATEPART(MONTH, MIN(OrderDate)) AS CohortMonth -- Get the Month of the first purchase
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
    GROUP BY CustomerID
),
CustomerOrders AS (
    SELECT
        fpc.CustomerID,
        fpc.CohortYear,
        fpc.CohortMonth,
        DATEPART(YEAR, soh.OrderDate) AS OrderYear,
        DATEPART(MONTH, soh.OrderDate) AS OrderMonth
    FROM FirstPurchaseCohort fpc
    JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader soh
        ON fpc.CustomerID = soh.CustomerID
)
SELECT * FROM CustomerOrders;
-- => The SQL query you have right now is only tracking the first purchase and subsequent second purchases (or any repeat purchases) in terms of the first purchase cohort.
```
3. Count Active Customers per Cohort Over Time
```sql
-- Now, calculate the number of active customers in each cohort for each month:
WITH FirstPurchaseCohort AS (
    SELECT
        CustomerID,
        DATEPART(YEAR, MIN(OrderDate)) AS CohortYear, -- Get the Year of the first purchase
        DATEPART(MONTH, MIN(OrderDate)) AS CohortMonth -- Get the Month of the first purchase
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
    GROUP BY CustomerID
),
CustomerOrders AS (
    SELECT
        fpc.CustomerID,
        fpc.CohortYear,
        fpc.CohortMonth,
        DATEPART(YEAR, soh.OrderDate) AS OrderYear,
        DATEPART(MONTH, soh.OrderDate) AS OrderMonth
    FROM FirstPurchaseCohort fpc
    JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader soh
        ON fpc.CustomerID = soh.CustomerID
),
CohortAnalysis AS (
    SELECT
        CohortYear,
        CohortMonth,
        OrderYear,
        OrderMonth,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS ActiveCustomers
    FROM CustomerOrders
    GROUP BY CohortYear, CohortMonth, OrderYear, OrderMonth
)
SELECT
    CohortYear,
    CohortMonth,
    OrderYear,
    OrderMonth,
    ActiveCustomers
FROM CohortAnalysis
ORDER BY CohortYear, CohortMonth, OrderYear, OrderMonth;
--=> This output helps you track the retention and activity of customers based on their first purchase in January 2011
--=> For example: In June 2011 (OrderYear = 2011, OrderMonth = 6), 7 unique customers from the January 2011 cohort made a purchase.
```
4. Calculate Retention Rates
```sql
-- To calculate retention rates, divide the number of active customers by the cohort size:
WITH FirstPurchaseCohort AS (
    SELECT
        CustomerID,
        DATEPART(YEAR, MIN(OrderDate)) AS CohortYear, -- Get the Year of the first purchase
        DATEPART(MONTH, MIN(OrderDate)) AS CohortMonth -- Get the Month of the first purchase
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
    GROUP BY CustomerID
),
CustomerOrders AS (
    SELECT
        fpc.CustomerID,
        fpc.CohortYear,
        fpc.CohortMonth,
        DATEPART(YEAR, soh.OrderDate) AS OrderYear,
        DATEPART(MONTH, soh.OrderDate) AS OrderMonth,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY fpc.CustomerID ORDER BY soh.OrderDate) AS OrderRank
    FROM FirstPurchaseCohort fpc
    JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader soh
        ON fpc.CustomerID = soh.CustomerID
),
ReturnCustomers AS (
    SELECT
        CustomerID,
        CohortYear,
        CohortMonth,
        OrderYear,
        OrderMonth
    FROM CustomerOrders
    WHERE OrderRank > 1  -- This filters out first-time purchasers (only return customers)
),
CohortSizes AS (
    SELECT
        CohortYear,
        CohortMonth,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS CohortSize
    FROM FirstPurchaseCohort
    GROUP BY CohortYear, CohortMonth
),
CohortAnalysis AS (
    SELECT
        fpc.CohortYear,
        fpc.CohortMonth,
        DATEPART(YEAR, soh.OrderDate) AS OrderYear,
        DATEPART(MONTH, soh.OrderDate) AS OrderMonth,
        COUNT(DISTINCT soh.CustomerID) AS ActiveCustomers,
        COUNT(DISTINCT rc.CustomerID) AS ReturnCustomers  -- Count only return customers
    FROM FirstPurchaseCohort fpc
    JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader soh
        ON fpc.CustomerID = soh.CustomerID
    LEFT JOIN ReturnCustomers rc
        ON soh.CustomerID = rc.CustomerID
        AND DATEPART(YEAR, soh.OrderDate) = rc.OrderYear
        AND DATEPART(MONTH, soh.OrderDate) = rc.OrderMonth
    GROUP BY fpc.CohortYear, fpc.CohortMonth, DATEPART(YEAR, soh.OrderDate), DATEPART(MONTH, soh.OrderDate)
)
SELECT
    ca.CohortYear,
    ca.CohortMonth,
    ca.OrderYear,
    ca.OrderMonth,
    ca.ActiveCustomers,
    ca.ReturnCustomers,  -- Show return customers
    cs.CohortSize,
    ROUND(ca.ReturnCustomers * 1.0 / cs.CohortSize, 2) AS RetentionRate  -- Round retention rate to 2 decimal places
FROM CohortAnalysis ca
JOIN CohortSizes cs
    ON ca.CohortYear = cs.CohortYear AND ca.CohortMonth = cs.CohortMonth
ORDER BY ca.CohortYear, ca.CohortMonth, ca.OrderYear, ca.OrderMonth;
```
5. pivot retention (just in case we need)
```sql
WITH FirstPurchaseCohort AS (
    SELECT
        CustomerID,
        MIN(DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate), 1)) AS CohortDate
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
    GROUP BY CustomerID
),
CustomerOrders AS (
    SELECT
        fpc.CustomerID,
        fpc.CohortDate,
        DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(soh.OrderDate), MONTH(soh.OrderDate), 1) AS OrderMonthDate,
        DATEDIFF(MONTH, fpc.CohortDate, soh.OrderDate) AS CohortIndex
    FROM FirstPurchaseCohort fpc
    JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader soh
        ON fpc.CustomerID = soh.CustomerID
),
CohortSizes AS (
    SELECT
        CohortDate,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS CohortSize
    FROM FirstPurchaseCohort
    GROUP BY CohortDate
),
RetentionAnalysis AS (
    SELECT
        co.CohortDate,
        co.CohortIndex,
        COUNT(DISTINCT co.CustomerID) AS RetainedCustomers
    FROM CustomerOrders co
    GROUP BY co.CohortDate, co.CohortIndex
)
SELECT 
    ra.CohortDate,
    cs.CohortSize,
    ra.CohortIndex,
    ra.RetainedCustomers,
    ROUND(ra.RetainedCustomers * 1.0 / cs.CohortSize, 2) AS RetentionRate
FROM RetentionAnalysis ra
JOIN CohortSizes cs 
    ON ra.CohortDate = cs.CohortDate
ORDER BY ra.CohortDate, ra.CohortIndex;

Figure 4: Cohort Analysis - Retention Rates

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RETENTION:

1. Leverage Repeat Purchases to Improve Retention
- Recommendation: Since repeat purchases significantly contribute to retention (as shown by the positive correlation between return customers and retention rate), focus on improving loyalty programs or introducing personalized offers to encourage customers to return. 

For example:
- Implement a rewards program where customers earn points for each purchase, which can be redeemed for discounts or exclusive offers.
- Target frequent buyers with exclusive deals or early access to new products to maintain their engagement.
2. Optimize Marketing Campaigns for Newer Cohorts
- Observation: Newer cohorts tend to be larger, but they also have lower retention rates. This suggests that while your business is successfully acquiring new customers, you may struggle with retaining them over time.
- Recommendation: Focus marketing efforts on new customer onboarding to improve retention for these larger cohorts. 

Consider:
- Sending personalized welcome emails with special first-time buyer offers.
- Offering post-purchase follow-ups to enhance the initial experience and remind customers of additional products that may interest them.
- Utilizing email automation to nurture these customers into loyal, repeat buyers.
3. Address Declining Retention with Proactive Strategies
- Observation: There's a slight decline in retention over the years, possibly due to changing customer behavior or increased competition.

To combat this decline, you should consider:
- Predictive churn models: Use past customer behavior (e.g., purchase frequency, basket size) to identify customers who are at risk of churn. Send targeted retention offers to re-engage these customers before they fully disengage.
- Enhancing the customer experience through personalized recommendations, superior customer service, and more tailored communications.
- Post-purchase engagement: Use automated email sequences to re-engage customers who havenâ€™t made a purchase in a while. Offer discounts, ask for feedback, or highlight new product arrivals to bring them back.
4. Improve Retention for Customers Acquired in Late Months
- Observation: Cohort months later in the year show slightly lower retention, possibly due to seasonal effects.
- Recommendation: For customers acquired in later months, create seasonal retention strategies that align with their purchasing habits. 

This could include:
- Targeted ads or offers that are relevant to their interests during the off-season.
- Offering seasonal promotions or exclusive end-of-year sales to incentivize purchases after their initial engagement.
- Encourage engagement with reminder emails for products they might need to restock, like seasonal items or accessories.
5. Maximize Cohort Engagement in Months 5-7
- Observation: Higher retention rates are seen in cohorts from months 5 to 7.
- Recommendation: Since retention is higher in these months, identify and replicate the drivers that contribute to stronger engagement. 

Consider:
- Timing your promotions: Ensure that promotions or new product releases are aligned with these peak engagement months to maximize their impact.
- Upselling or cross-selling: In these high-engagement months, upsell customers with complementary products or offer package deals that encourage larger orders.
6. Investigate and Enhance Engagement with Customers from Cohorts After 2013-06
- Observation: After June 2013, return customers seem to make purchases more regularly across cohorts.
- Recommendation: Investigate what changed in your customer experience or marketing strategy post-2013 to better understand why this pattern emerged.

Consider:
- Analyze changes in product offerings, pricing, or marketing approaches that could have contributed to the increased regularity of returns.
- Use these insights to enhance personalization across customer segments, making the buying experience more tailored and rewarding for customers.
7. Monitor and Manage Cohorts with Low Engagement
- Observation: Cohorts from 2011-05 to 2013-05 stopped purchasing by 2014-06, possibly due to market saturation or competitive pressures.
- Recommendation: For these groups, take proactive steps to either re-engage or gracefully disengage. 

Consider:
- Conducting win-back campaigns that offer customers incentives to return, such as discounts or bundled deals.
- Exit surveys for customers who stop purchasing to understand the root causes (pricing, competition, product dissatisfaction) and adapt your offerings.
- If market saturation is the issue, consider diversifying your product range or offering exclusive, limited-time products to reignite interest in these cohorts.
8. Utilize Seasonality to Drive Engagement
- Observation: Cohorts from May to August show higher return rates, likely due to seasonal effects or marketing efforts.

Maximize seasonal trends by:
- Running seasonal promotions targeting these months and using time-sensitive discounts to create urgency.
- Offering products that are seasonally relevant to these cohorts, such as summer or holiday-related items, to drive purchases.
- Consider launching seasonal campaigns or events in these months to build excitement and reinforce customer loyalty.
9. Improve Retention for Larger Cohorts
- Observation: Larger cohorts tend to show lower retention rates.

To address this, you might need to:
- Segment larger cohorts into smaller groups based on behavior, demographics, or product preferences and then tailor retention efforts to each group.
- Implement targeted retention strategies for high-value customers within large cohorts, such as VIP programs, early access to products, or personalized offers.

Figure 6: Cumulative Lifetime Value by cohort

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE 

1. Analyze Spending Spikes: 
- Identify the drivers behind spending spikes in specific months (e.g., 2011-07, 2012-04, 2013-12) to replicate successful promotions or seasonal strategies during those periods.

2. Focus on Retention: 
- Address the drop in spending over time by enhancing retention strategies, especially for cohorts showing signs of churn after the first year. This could include personalized outreach or loyalty programs.

3. Investigate Data Gaps: 
- Investigate the missing values to determine whether they indicate actual customer inactivity or data reporting issues. This will improve accuracy in CLV predictions and retention analysis.

4. Tailor Acquisition Strategies: 
- Recognize that different cohorts (e.g., 2011-06 vs. 2012-06) have different behaviors. Adapt customer acquisition strategies to meet the expectations and preferences of each cohort.

5. Nurture Early-Stage Customers: 
- Target early-stage customers with engaging strategies to turn them into repeat buyers, reducing churn and maximizing CLV.

6. Leverage Promotions and External Events: 
- Use knowledge of seasonal trends and promotions (e.g., May-Aug) to plan campaigns that align with high-revenue periods and customer purchasing behavior.

7. Enhance Post-2013 Cohorts: 
- Since post-2013 cohorts show more sustained revenue, focus on expanding this trend with strategies that maintain engagement and repeat purchases.

8. Address Churn in Older Cohorts: 
- For older cohorts (e.g., 2011-2013), analyze why customers stop purchasing (e.g., shift in strategy, product issues, competition) and adjust business practices to prevent churn.
